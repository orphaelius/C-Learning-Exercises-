/*
* write a program that keeps printing the multiples of the integer of 3, namely 3, 9, 27, 91, 273, etc. the loop should not terminate.

* initialize variables
* multiple

* while loop
* print multiples
* multiple value = multiple x 3 (sets each subsequent value in loop to current number x 3)* 
*

* LOGIC
* starting number at 1, bc powers start at 1
* while loop to increment, increment number at end of loop
* if number = 3, 9, 27, 81, etc... num 
* current number = number times 3
