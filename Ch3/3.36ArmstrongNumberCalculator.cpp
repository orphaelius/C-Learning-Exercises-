// Armstrong Numbers //

/*
* armstrong numbers are numbers that are equal to the sum of their digits raised to power of the number of digits in them. the number 153,
* for example, equals 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3. thus, it is an armstrong number. write a program to display all three-digit armstrong numbers.
*
* pseudocode
* oh boy
*
* initialize variables
* [starting_num] - initialize starting number. 
* [last_digit] - extract last digit, used to multiply it by power of 3
* [sum] - stores consecutive values, final sum of each digit to the power of 3
* [counter_num] - used to move to the next number in a numerically ordered series. starting_sum will be  used to reference at the end of each
* loop, counter_sum will be used each consecutive iteration to perform the next sum calculation
*
* print initial message to screen 
*
* first while loop
* while initial number is less than final number in series
* initialize counter number
* 
*	second while loop to run through each number* 
*	last_digit = num % 10 // extract the last digit for calculations
*	sum = last_digit * last_digit * last_digit
*	counter num = counter num / 10; // turns last digit into decimal value, thus discarding it (num is an integer value)
*	
* if sum equals the starting number in the loop, which is incremented by 1 each iteration, print "armstrong number"* 
*
* end program
