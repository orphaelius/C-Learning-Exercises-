a) input integer variable x with scanf. Use the conversion specification %d
b) input integer variable y with scanf. use the converstion specification %d

c) set integer variable i to 1
d) set integer variable power to 1

e) multiply integer variable power by x and assign the result to power

f) increment variable i by 1

g) test i to see if it's less than or equal to y in the condition of a while statement

h) output integer variable power with printf
