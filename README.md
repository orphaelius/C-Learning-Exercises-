# C
This repo follows my journey as I work through the exercises contained within How to Program by Deitel and Deitel. 

I have done my best to grow as a programmer and a problem-solver, sharpening my style, syntax, and conceptual
understanding of algorithms, etc. As such, clarity and legibility have improved during my progression. This is 
easily observable when comparing the first few chapters until chapter 6 or so when I beging to really understand
function decomposition, documentation, syntax, etc. 

Some files may cite external resources that I used to make certain elements of the programs successful-- I have 
done my best to cite these sources as necessary, a vital contribution to those who carved the path before me.
