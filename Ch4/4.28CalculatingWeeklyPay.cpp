// Calculating Weekly Pay //

/* a company pays its employees as managers (who receive a fixed
weekly salary), hourly workers (who receive a fixed hourly wage
for up to the first 40 hours they work and 1.5 times for overtime
hours worked), commission workers (who receive 250 plus 5.7% of 
their gross weekly sales), or piece-workers (who receive a fixed 
amount of money for each of the items they produce- each pieceworker
in this company works on only one type of item). write a program
to compute each employee's weekly pay. you do not know the number
of employees in advance. each type of employee has a pay code: 
managers are paycode 1, hourly have paycode 2, commission have 
paycode 3, and pieceworkers have paycode 4. use a switch to compute
each employee's pay based on the paycode. within the switch, prompt 
the user to enter the appropriate facts your program needs to 
calculate each employee's pay based on that employee's paycode.*/
